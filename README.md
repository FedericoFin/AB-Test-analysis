# AB-Test-analysis
Analysis of AB Test results

The aim of this project was to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website, thus 
help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the 
experiment longer to make their decision.

The statistical methods used in the projects were: hypothesis testing through one-tailed test by comparing
sample distribution simulating null hypothesis vs sample statistic, then confirmed with z-test. 
Furthermore the Logistic Regression approach was used. All approches gave same results, leading to the same 
recommendation.
